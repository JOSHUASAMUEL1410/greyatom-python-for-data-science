### Project Overview

 Data Science is a blend of various tools, algorithms, and machine learning principles with the goal to discover hidden patterns from the raw data. A Data Scientist will look at the data from many angles, sometimes angles not known earlier. Hence Data-Science plays major role in today's techonology, mainly for storing data. As the technology develops the Data analysts are responsible for interpreting data and analyzing the results utilizing statistical techniques and providing ongoing reports.Data analysts have to deal with a huge amount of data.It provides a large variety of applications used in data science. **Complex data sets can be simplified using Python easily.** **It is also relatively easier than other programming languages like Java, C, C#, etc.**

Python has become popular and the most important programming language in a very short time.With a broad set of libraries and inbuilt methods, Python has become the most convenient and accessible language to handle big data.Itâ€™s easy-to-use syntax, and better readability makes it more understandable. It has a simple and fast learning curve. It is a dynamically typed language, i.e. the variables are defined automatically. It has inbuilt methods for the majority of the mathematical functions. So, rather than writing the whole algorithm, we can just write the function name and our work will be done. It provides a large variety of applications used in data science.Complex data sets can be simplified using Python easily. It is also relatively easier than other programming languages like Java, C, C#, etc. It also provides more flexibility and ease in the field of machine learning and deep learning.

 Python is finding Increased adoption in **numerical computations, machine learning and several data science applications.**Python is a 23-year-old powerful expressive dynamic programming language where a programmer can write the code once and execute it without using a separate compiler for the purpose. **This makes python very convenient**.




### Learnings from the project

 I learnt to use python **numeric operators** and **the built in modules**. 


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I commited myself fiully while solving the problems. I figured out myself the mistakes that I made. Apart from the modules provided I learned **additional information**.


### Challenges faced

 If you want my honest opinion, the **entire**** project is a challenge**. I didn't face much challenges as I learned python earlier. 


### Additional pointers

 **_NO_**
